Smapifan Mod License Agreement

1. Use and Distribution
The distribution, monetization, or other usage of this mod is only allowed with explicit permission from the project lead Smapifan or an official team member.

2. Re-Textures
Re-textures that were created independently may be published and monetized. It is not allowed to publish re-textures that were not self-created or only contain minimal changes. If a re-texture is officially added to the project, the person who created it will receive full credit and be listed as a contributor.

3. Translations (i18n Files)
Translation files may not be monetized without approval â€“ for example via NexusMods Donation Points (DP) or similar systems.
A single team member is enough to receive such a request. The final decision will be discussed internally within the team.
Officially accepted translations will receive:
- Author credit
- Translation type (e.g. "German (full)", "French (partial)")
- Optional external link

If multiple translations of the same language are submitted, the first complete version will be prioritized.

4. Team Structure
This mod project is currently managed by:
- Smapifan (Project Lead)
- MettatonBugado
- MaggPlays

5. Contact
For questions, permissions, or collaboration inquiries, please contact one of the official team members.

Note:
This license serves to protect the work of the team and ensure fairness when handling external contributions. Any violations may result in removal of the affected content.
